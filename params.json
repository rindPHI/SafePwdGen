{"name":"SafePwdGen","tagline":"A deterministic password generator.","body":"# SafePwdGen\r\nSafePwdGen is a deterministic password generator. It lets you generate passwords\r\nbased on a seed password and a service identifier. If used correctly, you no longer\r\nneed to store / remember passwords; just generate them every time with this little tool.\r\nYou only need to remember the (secred) seed password and the way you generate identifiers,\r\ne.g. from URLs like \"myfancyplatform.com\".\r\n\r\n## Build and run\r\n\r\nJust run `ant` in the main directory to compile the project.\r\nStart SafePwdGen by calling `java -jar SafePwdGen.jar [options]`.\r\nAn empty list of arguments results in the self-explaining output\r\n\r\n```\r\nMissing required options: s, i\r\nusage: java -jar SavePwdGen.jar [options]\r\n -c,--special-chars <With special chars (TRUE|false)>   Set to true if\r\n                                                        special chars\r\n                                                        !-_?=@/+* are\r\n                                                        desired, else\r\n                                                        false\r\n -h,--help                                              Prints this help\r\n                                                        message\r\n -i,--service-identifier <Service Identifier>           The service that\r\n                                                        the password is\r\n                                                        created for, e.g.\r\n                                                        facebook.com\r\n -l,--pwd-length <Password Length>                      Length of the\r\n                                                        password in\r\n                                                        characters\r\n -s,--seed-password <Seed Password>                     Password used as a\r\n                                                        seed\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example usage\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./SafePwdGen.jar -s 'mySecretPassword123!!!' -i 'mymailprovider.com'\r\n\r\nGenerated Password: Yo?-I0Mb1vTHIb+xxcm7\r\n\r\nI tried to copy the generated password to your system clipboard.\r\nThis may have failed if you are using Gnome or some derivative of it.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis file is part of SafePwdGen, a deterministic password generator.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2014-2015 by Dominic Scheurer.\r\n\r\nSafePwdGen is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nSafePwdGen is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
